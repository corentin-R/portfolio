This project is a C++ game done as part of the Club Elec of the ISEN Brest for the open house day.

The player control the tank by moving to the left or the right thanks to OpenCV (color tracking).
To fire the player uses the left button of a mouse.
The GUI is done with the SDL library.

Below are some screenshots of the game:
