During our 4th year at ISEN, we had to do an electronic/software project during the year.

The subject of this project was to create a home monitoring system based on a thermic and an ultrasonic sensor.
The hardware was imposed and we had to create an IÂ²C bloc on an Altera FPGA (the Cyclone V running the Nios II soft-processor).

If a person was detected, a SMS was send thanks to a GSM module communicating with the NIOS processor with an UART and AT-Commands.
